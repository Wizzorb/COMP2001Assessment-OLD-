                <p>This dataset was chosen to be displayed, as it shows a very stark pattern compared to the other datasets. The trend for crime is in a clear downward slope, decreasing by over 10'000 recorded cases each year. The dataset has a larger breakdown of different offences and their statistics, but I chose the total to display in order to show the trend of each of the crimes in a better fashion.</p>
